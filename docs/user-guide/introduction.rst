Introduction
============

RPM Support for Pulp allows you to create and publish repositories of RPM
packages (including rpm, srpm, drpm, errata, and distributions).

* Automatically retrieve packages from external repositories and put them into
  local Pulp repositories.
* Upload your own packages into local Pulp repositories.
* Copy packages from one local repository to another, enabling you to promote
  testing versions to a production repository.
* Push packages out to large numbers of consumers.
* Track from the server what packages are installed on each consumer.
